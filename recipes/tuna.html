    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>I consider this the king of comfort food casseroles. What I love about this recipe, other than that it is simple and easy, is that it doesn't require the traditional can of cream of mushroom soupâ€”but it still has the same amount of creamy, decadent goodness that every casserole should. Serve this with a green salad on the side.
